# Fire MotD Generator for displaying custom system information

### Idea

This tool displays useful system information after logging into a Linux system (or Windows with FireMotD.ps1), such as version, CPU information, 
memory, disk information, number of updates, and many more useful things.

### Installation

#### Dependencies

##### Using yum
```
sudo yum install bc sysstat jq moreutils
```

##### Using apt-get
```
sudo apt-get install bc sysstat jq moreutils
```

#### Built-in Install function

Run this command from you homefolder:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoguiders/FireMotD/master/FireMotD -o /tmp/FireMotD && chmod 755 /tmp/FireMotD && sudo /tmp/FireMotD -I -d && /tmp/FireMotD -G all -d
```

#### Generating caches

To speed up things a bit, you need to generate cache files for the themes you are using. YOu can do this with the '-G' parameter. For example this will generate the cache for the Eline theme:
```bash
FireMotD -G Eline
```
Or this will generate caches for all available themes:

```bash
FireMotD -G all -d
```

#### Make

You need to have `make` installed on the system, if you want to use the Makefile.

##### To install to /usr/local/bin/FireMotD
```bash
sudo make install
```
With this you can probably run FireMotD from anywhere in your system. If not, you need to add `/usr/local/bin` to your `$PATH` variable. To adjust the installation path, change the var `IDIR=/usr/local/bin` in the Makefile to the path you want.

##### To install bash autocompletion support
```bash
sudo make bash_completion
```
With this you can use TAB to autocomplete parameters and options with FireMotD.
Does not require the sudo make install above (system install), but requires the `bash-completion` package to be installed and working. Then you should logout-login or source the bash completion file, eg. `$ . /etc/bash_completion.d/FireMotD`  

If you don't have root access, just install everything on your user's folder and source the file from your user's .profile file

### Crontab to get system information

Root privilege is required for this operation. Only `/etc/crontab` and the files in `/etc/cron.d/` have a username field.
 
The recommended way to generate /var/tmp/FireMotD.json is by creating a separate cron file for firemotd like this:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/cron.d/FireMotD
# FireMotD system updates check (randomly execute between 0:00:00 and 5:59:59)
0 0 * * * root perl -e 'sleep int(rand(21600))' && /usr/local/bin/FireMotD -S &>/dev/null
```

But you can also put it in root's crontab (without the user field):

```bash
sudo crontab -e
# FireMotD system updates check (randomly execute between 0:00:00 and 5:59:59)
0 0 * * * perl -e 'sleep int(rand(21600))' && /usr/local/bin/FireMotD -S &>/dev/null
```

### Apt configuration to update updates count

On systems with apt (Debian, Ubuntu, ...) add the following configuration lines to refresh the updates count after an apt action (install, remove, ...) was performed.

Create the apt configuration file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/15firemotd` containing:
```bash
DPkg::Post-Invoke {
 Â "if [ -x /usr/local/bin/FireMotD ]; then echo -n 'Updating FireMotD available updates count ... '; /usr/local/bin/FireMotD -sru -S; echo ''; fi";
};
```

### Adding FireMotD to run on login

Choosing where to run your script is kind of situational. Some files will only run on remote logins, other local logins, or even both. You should find out what suits best your needs on each case.

##### To add FireMotD to a single user
Edit the user's `~/.profile` file, `~/.bash_profile` file, or the `~/.bashrc` file
```bash
nano ~/.profile
```

Add the FireMotD call at the end of the file (choose your theme)
```bash
/usr/local/bin/FireMotD -T Red
```

##### To add FireMotD to all users
You may call FireMotD from a few different locations for running globally.  
Eg.` /etc/bash.bashrc`, `/etc/profile`.  

You may also create a initialization script `init.sh` which will call the `FireMotD` script in `/etc/profile.d` when logging in. You can put whatever you like in this init.sh script. Everything in it will be executed at the moment someone logs in your system. Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
 
/usr/local/bin/FireMotD -T Digipolis
```

### Multi-threading

If you want to try up FireMotD even more, you can use the '-MT' switch, which will enable multi-threading for the Explore functions. THis is still a somehwat experimental feature and will result in the CPU Usage as reported relatively high, as multiple Explore functions are running while mpstat is calculating the average CPU usage.
